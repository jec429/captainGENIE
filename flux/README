Example Fluxes:

  ** Flux files generously provided by Mary Bishai.  This are on axis at
     810 km.  These only apply if we decide to put CAPTAIN in the MINOS
     hall. 
       
       Neutrino running:     fluka08_me000z200i_810km_0kmoa_flux.txt
       Antineutrino running: fluka08_me000z200ni_810km_0kmoa_flux.txt
  
 ** NuMI_numuflux.txt contains the medium-energy muon neutrino flux.  The
    units are neutrinos/GeV/m^{2}/10^{6} POT.  The ROOT file was provided
    by Aaron Higuera Pichardo and then converted into a text file.
